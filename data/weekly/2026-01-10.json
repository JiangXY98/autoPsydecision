    "research_score": 55,
    "reasoning_research": "The study presents a clear clinical cohort and diagnostic pipeline, but the sample size is small (n=21) and the methodology is descriptive without experimental manipulation or computational modeling. The reliance on standard clinical guidelines (ACMG) and commercial software provides a baseline of rigor, but there is no mention of preregistration, control groups, or robustness checks beyond standard clinical reporting.",
    "impact_score": 30,
    "reasoning_impact": "The findings are relevant to clinical genetics and diagnostic neurology, but they have minimal direct relevance to the core topics of decision neuroscience, such as self-control, attention, or computational models of choice. The implications are confined to improving diagnostic yield in hereditary neuropathies, with no stated connection to decision-making processes or theoretical advances in psychology.",
